# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# WeatherInfo
WeatherInfo is a responsive weather forecasting web application built using React. It allows users to get real-time weather data such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions by entering any city name. The project uses live OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and displays it in a clean and user-friendly UI.
