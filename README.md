# WeatherInfo
WeatherInfo is a responsive weather forecasting web application built using React. It allows users to get real-time weather data such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions by entering any city name. The project uses live OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and displays it in a clean and user-friendly UI.
